### Hi there 👋
My name is **Pierre Sibert** and I'm a last year French High School pupil 🏢

### Projects and Contributions
📍 I don't spend a lot of time working on my projects, but I do it nonetheless

  - [My french website](https://pierronus.tk), I think it's the project I spent the most time at, but it was worthit anyway.
  
  -  (I didn't start this project at the time I write this).
     [TI82 Programs](https://github.com/Pierronus/ti-calculator-programs), is a project where I post little programs I make for the TI82 calculator, using Pyhton.
