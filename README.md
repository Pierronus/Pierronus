### Hi there üëã
My name is **Pierre Sibert** and I'm a second year French high school pupil at Lyc√©e Montesquieu

### Projects and Contributions
üìç I don't spend much time making and programming stuff, I only do it for fun.

- [Discord Bots](https://github.com/Pierronus/discord-bots), i'm really enjoying making discord bots for other servers, whether it's free or not. I already have made a full  ticket bot system (discord.js v12.5.1), for now, ths bot's code is in a private repo, but I plan on making it open-source.

- [Spigot Plugins](https://github.com/Pierronus/spigot-plugins), i recently learned to code in Java for a minecraft server i work on.

- [Python Codes](https://github.com/Pierronus/numworks-python), in this repo i will publish my numworks calculator python i write for fun in class
