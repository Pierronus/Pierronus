### Hi there üëã
My name is **Pierre Sibert** and I'm a last year French High School pupil üè¢

### Projects and Contributions
üìç I don't spend much time making and programming stuff, I only do it for fun.

  - [My french website](https://pierronus.com), My website. I am slowly (but surely) making progress on developping it.
  
  -  (I didn't start yet).
     [TI82 Programs](https://github.com/Pierronus/ti-calculator-programs), is a project where I post little programs I make for the TI82 calculator, using Pyhton.
     
  - [Discord Bots](https://github.com/Pierronus/discord-bots), i'm really enjoying making discord bots for other servers, whether it's free or not. I already have made a full  ticket bot system (discord.js v12.5.1), for now, ths bot's code is in a private repo, but I plan on making it open-source.
